This is an assignment for my discrete structures class;

Python Assignment 4.10.19 
CSCS-26

Create a program to simulate
Random Access Memory

1 create an array  at least 12K long
Set up a word length (8 bits)

Fill the Array with Random Data. (8bits each)

Read and Return(display) the data from 
the 100th record 
the 1000th recordo

verwrite the 99th record and the 999th record with zeroâ€™s  

Again 
Read and Return the data from the 100th record 
the 1000th record

how many records can your array hold?
Do a dump(display) of every other record.

Save your script, we will be modifying it next to do sorting algorithims.!
